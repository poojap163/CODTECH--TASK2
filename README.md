#### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model using linear regression to predict a target variable based on one or more independent variables. The project involves data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and interpretation of results. The specific goal is to understand the relationship between the predictors and the target variable and to use this relationship to make accurate predictions.

#### Key Skills Used
##### Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outliers, and data normalization.
##### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data to understand its structure and identify patterns.
##### Linear Regression Modeling: Building and evaluating a linear regression model.
##### Feature Engineering: Creating new features or modifying existing ones to enhance model performance.
##### Model Evaluation: Using metrics like R-squared and Mean Absolute Error to assess the modelâ€™s accuracy.
##### Dealing with Multicollinearity: Detecting and addressing multicollinearity issues using VIF (Variance Inflation Factor).

#### Technical Tools and Libraries Used
##### Programming Language: Python
####  Libraries:
##### Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
##### NumPy: For numerical computations.
##### Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
##### Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models and evaluation metrics.

#### Key Insights
##### Data Quality Issues: Identified and addressed missing values and outliers, ensuring the data is suitable for modeling.
##### Linear Relationships: Established that the data has linear relationships between the predictors and the target variable, making linear regression an appropriate model choice.
##### Model Performance: Evaluated the model's performance using R-squared, which measures the proportion of variance explained by the model, and Mean Absolute Error, which measures the average magnitude of errors.
##### Multicollinearity: Detected multicollinearity among independent variables using VIF and addressed it through feature engineering or variable selection.
##### Predictive Power: The model provides insights into which variables are most influential in predicting the target variable and how changes in these variables are expected to impact predictions.
This project demonstrates the process of developing a predictive model using linear regression, from data preparation to model evaluation and interpretation. It highlights the importance of understanding data, making informed choices about model assumptions, and carefully evaluating model performance.
